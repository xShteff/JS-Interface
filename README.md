# JSMapScroll
A simple javascript mini-project I made one night at 2 AM. It gives you to possibility to scroll content (a map, in this case, please don't sue me PlayerUnknown's for using your map) by dragging through the content. I also added the possibility of zooming the map. Kind of wanky and I will probably not use it, but it works.
