# JS-Interface

## Idea
Attempting to build some kind of game interface that I might or might not use at a later point.
## Features:
* Navigate through map (Currently a mock from PUBG)
* Zoom-in and out in map (disabled, but there)
* Draggable window manager system (works with the header)

## Ideas (Kind of a TODO list): 
The As already mentioned, it might become an actual game. At one point I might set up an ASP.NET (not Core) backend with a player/login system. I'm also planning to have an actual map with locations that trigger events, and not borrow the one from PUBG.

## Purpose
Nothing, really. I just realised that I've known JavaScript for a while and there's many things I've never done before. I'm using this to practice my skills and see how far I can get with it.
